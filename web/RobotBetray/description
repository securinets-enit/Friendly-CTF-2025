challenge name : RobotBetray
dificulty: easy
You’ve stumbled upon a live production employee portal still exposed to the internet.
Most of the interface looks clean and well-guarded, but developers often forget that true security is more than just hiding things.

Access beyond this point is restricted — or at least, it’s supposed to be.

Think like a hacker. Poke around. Find something that wasn’t meant for you.
