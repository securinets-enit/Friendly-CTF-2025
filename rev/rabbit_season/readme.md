# Description
And behold, in the earth there was a deep and shadowed pit, which the rabbit, swift of foot, did enter in haste, trusting in the darkness. Yet the wise beheld the path, for their eyes were not dimmed by the veil of the hole. And though the rabbit, in its ignorance, was ensnared, the prudent did walk circumspectly, for their understanding was as a light unto their feet. Thus, they outwitted the pit, and walked in peace, while the rabbit perished in its own folly. â€”Salamanki, Book of Securinets, Chapter XII, Verse 8
