# Description 


Just few years later, after the WW2, the British colonizer decided that it is enough killing for them, so they wanted to pass on the killing and oppression to someone else to finish the job and excell at it. 

So they requested that a famous organization, that is supposed to assure peace and security for all people, to find a solution to the land of Palestine because the palestinian were still resisting to these forces to prevent them from taking their land.

So this famous organization casually gave 55% of the land to the Jewish people and the rest to the Arab Muslim community; the indeginous people.

Just a year later Israel is officially a state. That is where everything will take a whole new turn.
