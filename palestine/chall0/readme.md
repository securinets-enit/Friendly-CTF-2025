What is happening in Palestine has changed something deep within me, especially over these past months. It is with pain, pride, and tears that I write this series.

Take a step back. Put everything else aside. This may be the most emotionally stirring challenge you’ll encounter in a CTF.

The objective of this series is to immerse you in the realities of Palestine—its history, its struggle, its geopolitics, and its resistance. We hope it educates, moves, and inspires you to learn more.
