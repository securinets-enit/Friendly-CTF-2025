# Description


The settling began. Jewish people came from all over the world thinking the land was theirs, taking on everyone and everything they evaluate as theirs.
Palestinians, who were already resentful because of the increasing number of Jewish settlers, demonstrated in Jerusalem in February 1920. Approximately 1,500 people came on to the streets after the declaration of the enforcement of the Balfour Declaration.


All until a group of rabbis urged Jewish immigrants to gather at a specific place to perform a public prayer. The aim after the call was to seize this place and declare it as a sacred place for Jews. 

Palestinians were outraged and clashes erupted. Fights between Arab Palestinians and Jews backed by British occupation forces, continued for two weeks. Hundreds of Arab Palestinians were killed in the confrontations by the British occupation and the armed jews. A commision was sent to evaluate the state and finally submitted a report where it concluded that the area around the place was an Islamic endowment, but that the Jews could continue their prayers at It with certain restrictions.
