Israel’s war on Palestine today did not begin in a vacuum—it stretches back over a century, long before 1948 and the Balfour Declaration.

After World War I, Britain seized control of Palestine following the fall of a certain Empire. From that moment onward, Palestine has endured occupation, displacement, and relentless oppression.

This is not just history. This is an ongoing struggle for justice.

For this challenge, we will start from that moment. Then following up to one of the most marking moments in the Palestinian Genocoide.
