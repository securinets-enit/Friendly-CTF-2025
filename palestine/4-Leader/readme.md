# Description

In the 1930s, Jewish immigration to Palestine spikedâ€”peaking at 61,000 in 1935. By 1936, settlers comprised over 1/3 of the population.

Mass land settlements displaced Palestinians, fueling conflict. A 1929 British report warned this would cause unrest, as both sides knew demographics would decide Palestine's fate.
This lead up to the famous Palestinian Revolution in 1936 that aimed at stopping the jewish settlement and the forced overtaking of the lands. 

An anti-Zionist militant organization was established in 1930s by a famous leader that will be marked later in history as a resistence and strength symbol. And his name will always bring terror to the zionists.

> Surrounded, he told his men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His defiance and manner of his death (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.'
