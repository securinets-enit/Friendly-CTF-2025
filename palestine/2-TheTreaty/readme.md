# Description

In essence, the Balfour Declaration promised Jews a land where the **natives made up more than 90 percent of the population.**

Something was proved very wrong firstly in 1919: then-US President Woodrow Wilson appointed a commission to look into public opinion on the system in Syria and Palestine. The investigatio found that the majority of Palestinians expressed a strong opposition to Zionism, leading the conductors of the commission to advise a modification of the mandate’s goal. 

The Commission submitted its report to the Paris "Peace" Conference in August 1919. Its working being undercut from the beginning by France and the United Kingdom's pact, the Sykes–Picot Agreement, and colonialist designs, the Conference had largely concluded the area's future by the time the report was finished.
